This ebook is a dry, lifeless, and uninspiring guide to making money on Instagram.  It reads like a generic, unoriginal, and formulaic business textbook, completely devoid of personality and any real sense of how people actually use Instagram.  The author is trying to "tell" the reader about Instagram rather than "show" them.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and suggestions for improvement:

**1.  Lack of Storytelling:** The ebook reads like a list of ideas rather than a compelling narrative.  Instead of simply listing the 10 ways to make money, the author should create a narrative flow with captivating stories, relatable anecdotes, and insights that bring the ideas to life.

* **Instead of:** "Loja do Instagram: Descubra como vender produtos diretamente na plataforma, com dicas sobre fotos de qualidade, preços competitivos, atendimento ao cliente e storytelling eficaz." 
* **Try:** "Imagine scrolling through your feed and stumbling upon a vibrant, hand-painted tote bag. It’s not just a product – it’s a piece of art crafted with passion by a local artist. You click to learn more, discover a beautiful shop on Instagram, and impulsively purchase the bag, knowing it’s unique and supports a small business."

**2.  Generic Language:**  The writing is overly formal and lacks personality.  The author should use engaging language, vivid descriptions, and conversational tone to connect with the reader.

* **Instead of:** "Aprenda a criar conteúdo exclusivo para assinantes pagantes, oferecendo valor real e construindo uma comunidade engajada."
* **Try:** "Want to build a loyal fanbase that flocks to your every post?  Unlock the secrets of exclusive content for members-only.  Imagine offering behind-the-scenes glimpses, personalized advice, and exclusive early access to new products – your most devoted fans will be thrilled to pay for this VIP experience."

**3.  Excessive Emphasis on Numbers:**  The author relies heavily on numerical projections without grounding them in real-world examples.  Instead of focusing on theoretical revenue, the author should showcase inspiring stories of real people who have used these strategies to build successful businesses on Instagram.

* **Instead of:** "Se Gabriel vender seus filtros a R$ 5 cada e realizar 100 vendas por mês, sua receita mensal seria de R$ 500. À medida que sua coleção de filtros cresce e ele ganha reconhecimento na comunidade do Instagram, seus ganhos podem aumentar exponencialmente."
* **Try:** "Meet Gabriela, a creative genius who turned her passion for digital art into a thriving business.  She designs playful and quirky filters that add a touch of whimsy to people’s photos, and her Instagram account is buzzing with fans eager to try her latest creations.  Gabriela’s filters are so popular, she earns a comfortable income selling them to users worldwide, proving that passion and creativity can be a powerful formula for success."

**4.  Lack of Visual Appeal:**  The ebook is purely text-based, making it dry and dull.  The author should incorporate visuals like screenshots, graphics, and engaging photos to break up the text and enhance the reading experience.

* **Instead of:** "Explore dicas sobre escolha de parceiros, comunicação clara e objetivos da parceria."
* **Try:**  Include a screenshot of a successful Instagram collaboration post, with a caption highlighting the key elements of communication and shared goals.

**5.  Missing "Show Don't Tell" Opportunities:**  The ebook relies on a "tell" approach, explaining each strategy without showing the reader how it works in practice.  The author should use real-life examples, case studies, or step-by-step guides to demonstrate the strategies.

* **Instead of:** "Discover how to choose products aligned with your audience, create informative content, and optimize your affiliate links."
* **Try:**  Showcase an Instagram post with a compelling product recommendation, highlighting the affiliate link and the strategic language used to engage the audience.

**6.  Lack of Connection to the Instagram Experience:**  The ebook fails to capture the unique energy and personality of Instagram.  The author should use authentic language, relevant hashtags, and a conversational tone that reflects how people interact on the platform.

* **Instead of:** "O Instagram como plataforma de sucesso e realização profissional."
* **Try:** "Instagram isn’t just a platform – it’s a community.  It’s a space where passions are ignited, connections are forged, and dreams take flight.  With a little creativity and hustle, you can turn your Instagram presence into a launchpad for your own success story."

**In conclusion,** the author needs to inject personality, storytelling, and visual elements into this ebook to make it engaging and inspiring.  By focusing on "show, don't tell," incorporating real-world examples, and embracing the unique spirit of Instagram, the author can transform this dry business guide into a captivating and actionable resource for readers looking to monetize their Instagram presence.
